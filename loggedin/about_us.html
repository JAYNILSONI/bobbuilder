			<p>Starting in August 2022, the BOBBUILDER project is intended to provide an online platform that estimates costing of structures as well as also provides a platform for the constructor to present their work. This web application also includes the sign-up and sign-in option for constructors to create a profile. The project has both technical and ethical goals. The technical purposes underscore the advantages to people finding a constructor there nearby as well as it will help to estimate the cost. Ethically, however, the project raises questions about structure costing overall. This project is designed to be used by normal people as well as constructors to estimate structure cost and also to unlock features to search for constructors there nearby. It is a web application through which people can also estimate required bags of cement, tons of sand, tons of aggregates, kgs of steel, ltr of paints, pcs of bricks, and flooring. The web application is user-friendly. The web application got the feature to create a profile for constructors to present their company and work. The constructors have to provide general information about their company to sign up. The user can easily find registered constructors on site and directly contact them as per their need. The user directly enters the area in square feet to estimate the cost and materials. The design is pretty simple and the user wonâ€™t find it difficult to understand, use, and navigates.</p>
